From [Wikibase/DataModel](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/DataModel#Overview_of_the_data_model):

> For lack of a better name, any such basic assertion that one can make in Wikidata is called a **Snak** (which is small, but more than a byte). This term will not be relevant for using Wikidata (editors will not encounter it), but it is relevant for developers to avoid confusion with Statements or other claims.
